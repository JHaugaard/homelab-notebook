### Homelab Notebook

#### Project name: homelab-notebook

**Background:** I am an eager hobbyist learner of web development who is completely excited about self-hosting a robust inffrastrure and building apps and sites on this infrastructure OR using the best deployment strategy for the each project. I am using Claude Code as a brainstroming, research, and coding partner to en extent I never imagined. I am amassing stacks of resource materials, learning techniiquess, and most of all coming up with ideas for projects and sites. I do all this for my personal enjoyment and fulfillment, and with no commercial concern or consequence. I can and will build, learn, and move on for a project. Or I can build, learn, and refine a project to turn it into a daily driver.

**Pain Point:** I have too many resources, too many snippets of “brilliance” that I find, fragments of idea, workflows started they temporarily interrupted and other events and needs take precedence. I need to corral all of this in a manner that will permit easy entry and quick and reliable search and retrieval.

**Goal:** Build a lightweight and streamlined Homelab Notebook app to get things under reliable control with the minimum of friction.
